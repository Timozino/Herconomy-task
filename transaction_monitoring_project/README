# My Django Project

This is a brief description of my Django project.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment:e.g `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` form mac & venv\Scripts\activate for windows
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. install docker
6. Run docker-compose build to build an image inside the container
7. Run docker-compose up to spin up container
8. migrations in container, and mailhog in docker will automatically be ran
9. No need to run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`, it will be handled by docker

## Usage

I sent screenshots of rounting to different urls.

## Technologies:
Python, Django, DRF, Mailhog for email testing (which is the standard), and Docker
